AspNet Identity 2.0 Extensible Project Template
===============================================
This project expands upon the work done by the ASP.NET Identity Team in the Identity Samples project. The goal is to provide a basic project template wherein the core identity Model classes are easily extensible without messing about with the generic type arguments.

While extending the basic ApplicationUser class provided in teh original Identity Samples project was always relatively straightforward, Extending the Role implementation required some significant work. 

In this project, you can simply add additional properties and/or methods to any of the Identity Model classes as defined in the IdentityModels.cs file.
